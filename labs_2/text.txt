Itâ€™s a very good idea to do a retrospective on the deal mid-way and at the end (or even more frequently) to learn from successes and failures and improve the process. If the company is large enough to justify having an M&A Centre of Excellence, such retrospectives are a good artefact to contribute to it and an excellent starting point for contemplating new M&A deals. This may reduce the rate of repeated mistakes, streamline integration and increase M&A ROI.
